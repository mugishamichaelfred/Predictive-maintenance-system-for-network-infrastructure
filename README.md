# ========================================================

# The Predictive Maintenance System for Network Infrastructure demonstrated how machine learning can improve network management by predicting potential failures before they occur. By analysing key features like CPU utilization, memory utilization, and Traffic congestion, the system provided accurate predictions, with the Random Forest Classifier achieving the best performance at 75% accuracy. This proactive approach reduces downtime, enhances reliability, and optimizes resource allocation. While effective, future improvements such as real-time implementation and feature enhancements could make the system even more robust, ensuring smarter and more efficient network maintenance.
